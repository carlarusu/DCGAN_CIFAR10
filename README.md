## CIFAR10 DCGAN experiment

DCGAN stands for deep convolutional generative adversarial networks. A GAN is meant to generate images and is composed of two parts:
- a discriminator: classifies whether an image is real or generated
- a generator: transforms input into a 2D image and must try to fool the discriminator
